This was the code I wrote for a sample network in CORE.
Each node (computer) in the network is capable of a few basic protocols such as: Sending messages to each other, pinging, FTP (file transfer protocol)
POST/ADVERTISE, ClockSync between all nodes as well as removing blackholes from the network.  Pathing is based off of the Link State Routing protocol.
